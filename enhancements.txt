Enhancements!

(1) Magnifying Glass.
    A magnifying glass that lets you magnify a certain radius around the mouse
    when the mouse's left button is held down. The magnification power can be
    increased and decreased by holding down "up arrow key" and "down arrow key"
    respectively. The minimum magnification power is two, while the maximum is
    ten.

(2) Event functions.
    We used event functions that checks whether the user is holding down the mouse
    button, whether he pressed the up or down arrow, and whether the user closed
    window.

(3) Meter Class.
    We made an extra class called Meter, the purpose of it is just to keep track
    of the value of a certain variable, in this program it is used to keep track
    of the magnification power.
